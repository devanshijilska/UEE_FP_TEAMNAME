SE3050 – User Experience Engineering
Final Project

In this assignment you have to come up with a solution to address an issue listed under UN Development goals (here) and the solution must be digital to be developed as a mobile application.

Project Outcome:  For this solution you will have to be part of a group of 4 people and create a basic mobile application which has a minimum of 4 functionalities for each individual that address different sub-functionalities of choice, for the desired solution. 

Main Components of This Project:
•	Idea – the solution you come up with must prove to be beneficial and realistic.
•	User Research – Each member should be able to address three main key functionalities through user research and should be able to present the user groups identified
•	UX Strategy – Create a UX strategy for your solution by identifying fail points/ blocking in the key user flow(s) and present the strategy based on data collected
•	Prototype – each member must be able to come up with wireframes/ low fidelity prototypes / sketches for each functionality where the solution is to be portrayed
•	Functional Specification Documentation – Each member must be able to address the solution by specifying each functionality through the functional specification document
•	Implementation - Each member must be able to address the solution in collaboration to implement the functionality proposed
•	Final Presentation – Solution must be presented 

Design Components of This Project:
•	Creating UI -These will be the separate areas to add content and navigate between.
•	Adding Graphics-These will be original images or pictures which can be added to the application.
•	Interactivity-This is an action we can add to a graphic to send the user to another place on the timeline or web link. 
•	Integrating an Information Architecture-This is the organization of content intended in the design of the application.


Duration of the project: 
Project will be a semester long project. Each component must be addressed at each milestone.
