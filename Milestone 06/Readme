Milestone 6: User Feedback for your Prototype 

Designers/evaluators rigorously test the complete product using the best solutions identified during the prototyping phase 

The results generated during the testing phase are often used to redefine one or more problems and inform the understanding of the users. 

Present the collected User Feedback to your supervisor and discuss it during the lab session
