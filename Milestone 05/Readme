Milestone 5: Wireframes, Prototype 

This is an experimental phase and Aim is to identify the best possible solution for each of the problems identified. 

Produce several inexpensive, scaled-down versions of the proposed solution(s) 

By the end of this stage, the design team will have a better idea of the constraints inherent to the productâ€¯and the problems that present a clearer view of how real users would behave, think, and feel when interacting with the end product. 

Present your prototype(s) to your supervisor and get feedback during the lab session
